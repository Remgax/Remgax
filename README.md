### Hi there 👋 Greetings and Salutation! 

Welcome to my GitHub page. 🖥️ Look around, you might find something useful. Also, I have a [dedicated organization](https://github.com/EKKE-IK-M5APWK) for my old school projects.

Here's something about me: 

🇭🇺 I live in Hungary, Budapest. I was born in 1993. I currently live in Budapest, but I would love to live in the UK 🇬🇧 or America 🇺🇸.

📚 I currently work as an Application Developer at National Széchényi Library. I mostly work on back-end development but also have tasks with database management, user support, and support for our integrated library software and systems. 

👯 I want to collaborate on projects involving video games or any related topic. I would love to learn more about designs and the industry in general. 

📫 How to reach me: You can use my [email address](mail:kormany.1993@gmail.com) or via Discord remgax.

⚡ Fun fact: What do tortoises do for fun?
Tortoises like space to roam, places to hide, and objects to interact with. They enjoy basking in the warmth, digging in the dirt to cool down, and some even enjoy playing with humans.
