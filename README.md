## About Me

I’m a **Software Developer & DevOps Engineer** with **8+ years of experience** in backend development, automation, and infrastructure management. I specialise in **PHP (Laravel, Symfony), Bash, Docker, and SQL databases** (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL), with strong experience in Linux server environments, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps practices.

I have worked primarily in **public sector and EU-funded projects**, delivering scalable, maintainable solutions, automating workflows, and supporting full lifecycle software delivery. I enjoy collaborating across cross-functional teams and contributing to long-term institutional IT operations.

🌍 Based in **Budapest, Hungary**, I’m open to **remote work or relocation within the EU**.
