### Hi there 👋 Greetings and Salutation! 

Welcome to my GitHub page. 🖥️ Look around, you might find something useful. Also, I have a [dedicated organization](https://github.com/EKKE-IK-M5APWK) for my school projects.

Here's something about me: 

🇭🇺 I live in Hungary, Budapest. I was born in 1993. I currently live in Budapest, but I would love to live in the UK 🇬🇧 or America 🇺🇸.

📚 I currently work as an Application Developer at National Széchényi Library. I mostly work on back-end development, but I also have tasks with database management, user support, and support for our integrated library software and systems. 

🔭 I’m currently working on my degree in Computer Science. It will be a video game using Unity. You can [check it out here.](https://github.com/EKKE-IK-M5APWK/World-of-Eronia)
Still, a lot to do (and even more to learn), but hopefully it will be finished at the end of 2022. 

Oh... and it will be Open Source! So you can use it for whatever and however, you like. It will have all the fundamentals as a base for your future game.

🎓 I’m currently studying at the Eszterházy Catholic University. On my last year now. Lots of fun technologies, and new perspectives.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving video games or any related topic. I would love to learn more about designs and about the industry in general. 

🎮 I have a few hobbys that I love to share. I love to play video games (I think you already guessed it), mostly playing MMORPGs or RBGs. I love the social aspect and playing with other people. My all-time favourite video games are Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and all the Star Wars Games. Diablo games, Baldurs Gate 3, Elite Dangerous and F1 games.

I have a lot of tabletop games at home, and also a lot of Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying books from Wizards of the Coast. You can't say no when it comes to Dragons and Dice. 🎲

⚡ Fun fact: What do tortoises do for fun?
Tortoises like space to roam, places to hide, and objects to interact with. They enjoy basking in the warmth, digging in the dirt to cool down, and some even enjoy playing with humans. 

I have two beautiful Greek tortoises. 🐢 Their personalities are wild. 🤣
