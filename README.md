## About Me

I’m a **Software Developer, DevOps Engineer & IT Support Specialist** with **8+ years of experience** in backend development, automation, and IT operations. I specialise in **PHP (Symfony, Laravel), Bash, Docker, and SQL databases** (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL), with strong expertise in Linux server environments, CI/CD pipelines, and workflow automation.

I have worked primarily on **public sector and EU-funded projects**, delivering scalable, maintainable solutions, modernizing legacy systems, automating processes, and supporting full lifecycle IT operations. I enjoy collaborating across cross-functional teams and bridging development, operations, and support functions.

🌍 Based in **Budapest, Hungary**, I’m open to **remote work or relocation within the EU**.
